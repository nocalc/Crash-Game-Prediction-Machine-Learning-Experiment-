# Crash Predictor ML ‚Äî OCR + Machine Learning Experiment

This project is an **experimental machine learning bot** that:
- Uses **OCR (EasyOCR + OpenCV)** to read crash multipliers live from the screen
- Tracks game history in real time
- Trains a **RandomForest Classifier + Regressor** (Scikit-Learn)
- Predicts the probability of high multipliers
- Provides a **Tkinter-based GUI** for live monitoring, settings, and training
- Supports auto-training and CSV logging for long sessions

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:**  
This project is for **educational purposes only**.  
It is **not a guaranteed profit tool** and should not be used for gambling.  
The purpose is to demonstrate OCR, real-time data capture, and ML prediction pipelines.
